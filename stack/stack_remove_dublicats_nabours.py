# Input: s = "abbaca"
# Output: "ca"
# Explanation:
# For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal,
# and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca",
# of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".






















# def removeDublicates(s):
#     stack = []

#     for c in s:
#         if stack and stack[-1] == c:
#             stack.pop()
#         else:
#             stack.append(c)

#     return "".join(stack)




# print(removeDublicates("abbaca"))
