# Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [3,-1]
# Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
# -  2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
# - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
